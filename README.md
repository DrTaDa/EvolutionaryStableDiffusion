You will need:
- A GPU
- To clone and install https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
- To download your favorite set of weights and copy them in the correct directory in stable-diffusion-webui/models 
- To create a file named words.txt in which you can put the words you want the evolutionary strategy to work with (one word per line).
- run `python evo_sd.py`
- At each generation, the evolutionary strategy will present 8 images. You can click on your 4 favorites which will trigger the creation of a new generation. Slowly the images will converge toward what you like.
